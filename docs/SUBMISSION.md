# SUBMISSION

## Project

- Name: `native`
- Tagline: `Become local. Stay safe. Act with confidence.`

## Problem statement fit

1. Multilinguality:
   - Realtime speech and visual-text understanding across Indian languages.
2. Localization:
   - Understands local forms, announcements, and context-specific process friction.
3. Consumer:
   - Solves daily navigation and trust problems for internal migrants.

## What is unique

`native` is **not just translation**. It is a **realtime local risk-aware companion**:

- sees text and surroundings,
- hears conversations/announcements,
- translates into user language,
- flags risks (price, misinformation, urgency),
- gives one-line next actions.

## Demo format for judges (3 minutes)

- 40s: Problem and migrant user story.
- 2m: Scene A + Scene B + Scene C live demo.
- 20s: Why Gemini Live enables one-loop multimodal risk-aware guidance.

## One-minute video structure

- 15s: Problem statement.
- 35s: Product in action (3 scenes quick cuts + risk banner moments).
- 10s: Impact close.

## Submission checklist

## Suggested short submission blurb

`native` helps migrants become locals instantly. It combines live translation with local risk guard signals (overcharge, misinformation, urgency) and immediate action guidance in one no-scroll command deck.

## Q/A cheat sheet

Q: `Is this just translation?`
A: No. Translation is only one layer. `native` adds structured local risk detection and immediate action guidance in realtime.

Q: `How is this different from existing realtime demos?`
A: Existing demos show multimodal understanding; `native` operationalizes that into migrant safety decisions: cue -> risk level -> what to do next.
